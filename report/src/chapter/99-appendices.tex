    function listBooks()
    List all books into the console.
    
    function removeBookByID(_id)
    Remove a book with the given ID. Will update the web UI and db.

    function selectAllToggle()
    Toggle select all books currently in the visible list. Will update the web UI and db.
    This function is coupled with the checkbox for selecting all books in the list.
    
    function query(parameter1, value1, parameter2, value2 ...)
    Queries the list of books for an array of books where the 
    specified book parameters match their respective values.
    May be called with an arbitrary even number of arguments. 
    The values will be interpreted as regular expressions if they are strings.

    function generateHTML()

    at the "BOOKTABLE" element in the HTML document.
    
    function retrieveObjects()
    This function retrieves all objects from the server and updates the web UI and db. 
    Will lock the UI until objects have been received.

\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Book object specification}
\begin{verbatim}
    function Book(title, author, id)
    Constructor for the Book object. Will add it to the list of Books in LIB. 
    Should be used with the new keyword.
    If id is null, the object will be sent to the server, and the id will be returned. 
    This will block the UI and then update it.
    Leaving out the id parameter entirely will be interpreted as the id being null.
    id should be null when using this from the console or web UI, 
    but defined in the callback function for retrieving Books.
    
    function saveUpdate()
    Update the book on the server, blocking/unblocking and updating the UI in the process.
    Should be called after altering the Book object's variables.

    function toJSON()
    Generate a JSON object from this Book.

    function changeTitle(newTitle)
    Change the name of the book. Will update the web UI and db.

    function toggleSelect()
    Toggle whether this book is selected. 
    Will make sure the value of the Book's checkbox is correct, if it exists.
    
    Remove this book from the system. Will update database and UI.
    function remove()

    function generateHTML()
